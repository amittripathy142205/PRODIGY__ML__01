🏡 House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

This project implements a Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms. The dataset used is from the [Kaggle House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data) competition.

📌 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to understand how basic housing attributes contribute to price estimation and to build a simple, interpretable model for predicting house prices using Linear Regression.

📊 Dataset Features Used

 ⦁	GrLivArea (Above ground living area in square feet)
 ⦁	BedroomAbvGr (Number of bedrooms above ground)
 ⦁	FullBath and HalfBath (Number of full and half bathrooms)

🛠️ Project Workflow

  ⦁	Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and selecting relevant features.
  ⦁	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing relationships between variables.
  ⦁	Feature Engineering: Combining and transforming features.
  ⦁	Model Building: Training a linear regression model on selected features.
  ⦁	Model Evaluation: Assessing performance using RMSE and R² score.

📈 Results

The trained model provides a simple yet interpretable prediction framework for estimating house prices using only a few core features.

🚀 Future Enhancements

 ⦁	Use more advanced regression models (Ridge, Lasso, XGBoost).
 ⦁	Include more features like neighborhood, year built, etc.
 ⦁	Deploy model using Flask or Streamlit for live predictions.
